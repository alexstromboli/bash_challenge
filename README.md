# Coding Challenge

Please write a Bash script, which would calculate and show
the **total byte size** of all the files with extension `.bin`,
in the root folder and all the nested subfolders.

I.e:
* `funny.bin` is 11607 bytes
* `domestic.bin` is 16486 bytes
* `outer/solid_hashes.bin` is 32574 bytes
* ... and so on

So, 11607 + 16486 + 32574 + ... = **???**
