# Coding Challenge

* Clone this repository.

* Write a Bash script, which would calculate and show
the **total byte size** of all the files with extension `.bin`
in this entire repository, in all the folders and subfolders.

I.e:
* `funny.bin` is 11607 bytes
* `domestic.bin` is 16486 bytes
* `outer/solid_hashes.bin` is 32574 bytes
* ... and so on

So, 11607 + 16486 + 32574 + ... = **???**
